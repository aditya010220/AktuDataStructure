# Data Structures - AKTU 3rd Semester

## Overview
This repository contains implementations of various data structures as per the Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam Technical University (AKTU) 3rd semester syllabus. This project aims to help students understand and practice data structures.

## Features
- Covers important data structures from the AKTU syllabus.
- Implementations in C language, as required in AKTU examinations.
- Well-structured and commented code for better understanding.
- Example programs to demonstrate the working of each data structure.

## Syllabus
The repository includes the following data structures:
- **Linked List** (Singly, Doubly, Circular)
- **Stacks** (Using Arrays and Linked Lists)
- **Queues** (Simple Queue, Circular Queue, Deque, Priority Queue)
- **Trees** (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees, B-Trees)

**Note**: Graph-related coding problems are not included as they are not required in the AKTU examination.
